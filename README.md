Project contents: 2 codes

codes: server and client

programming language written with: python

libraries used: 
    socket,
    threading,
    os,
    shutil.

Server functions: send text, receive text, receive file

Client functions: send text, receive text, send file


important notes:
   1-Client will not work if server not functional
   2-If socket didn't close correctly, socket needs to be changed the next time running both codes
   3-When naming the new file, file extension(example: .docm) needs to be written
   4-Client needs to know server's private ip address
   5-To start the function to send a file, type send_file(server will receive automatically)
   6-Publishing this is mainly for hackclub and for others to learn
